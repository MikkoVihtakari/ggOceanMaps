Description: Allows plotting data on bathymetric maps using 'ggplot2'. Plotting
  oceanographic spatial data is made as simple as feasible, but also flexible
  for custom modifications. Data that contain geographic information from 
  anywhere around the globe can be plotted on maps generated by the basemap()
  function using 'ggplot2' layers separated by the '+' operator. The package
  uses spatial shapefiles stored in the 'ggOceanMapsData' package, geospatial 
  packages for R to manipulate, and the 'ggspatial' package to help to plot 
  these shapefiles.
